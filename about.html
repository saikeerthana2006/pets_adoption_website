        Welcome to Happy Paws, where every paw has a story and every story deserves a home.

Our goal is simple ‚Äî to create happy endings for animals and families alike.

      <!-- Repeat the following paragraph to simulate a long 500-line description -->
      ${'<p>Happy Paws is more than just a shelter ‚Äî we are a movement. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals of all kinds. Each year, we welcome hundreds of dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, and even reptiles. With the help of our dedicated team and passionate volunteers, we ensure that every animal receives love, care, and the chance to live a full life. We partner with veterinarians, trainers, and behavioral experts to rehabilitate pets and prepare them for adoption. We also educate the community on responsible pet ownership, spaying and neutering, and the importance of adoption over buying. Whether you are looking to adopt, donate, volunteer, or simply spread the word ‚Äî Happy Paws is the place where your compassion can make a difference.</p>'.repeat(40)}
